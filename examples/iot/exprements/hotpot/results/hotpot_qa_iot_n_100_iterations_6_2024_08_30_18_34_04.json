It appears that this question may contain two separate references, as the valley of Jerry Roush could relate to Sky Eats Airplane, which he was associated with but not as a founding member. Given this complexity, I need to analyze deeper to ensure I answer accurately. The context explicitly states that Glass Cloud was formed in late 2011, hence it does not meet the criteria as Jerry Roush was a part of that band.",

Conversely, Glass Cloud, which includes Roush, was formed later in 2011. \n\nGiven this analysis, the direct answer to your question about the state where the band formed in mid-2009 exists is California, while Jerry Roush was not the lead vocalist of Of Mice & Men.",

We are searching for an American metalcore band that was founded in mid-2009 and whose lead vocalist was Jerry Roush. The key bands to consider here are Of Mice & Men and Glass Cloud.

This indicates a complexity in identifying a single band matching both criteria \u2013 the formation date and the lead vocalist.

The rivalry during the **Crimean War** in the 1850s.\n2. The **Great Game** dynamic for control over Central Asia in the late 19th century.\n3. Established alliances during **World Wars I and II**.\n4. Significant tensions occurring during the **Cold War** (1947\u20131991).\n\nConsidering the timeline, the abdication of Nicholas II occurred amidst political upheaval leading to the Russian Revolution. The context indicates that by **1917**, relations were strained due to the **Russian Revolution**, which marks the immediate aftermath of Nicholas II's abdication. This period did not align directly with a specific formal war but did entail significant geopolitical tensions. Furthermore, the Cold War is noted to have involved rivalries but began later, post-World War II. Given this analysis, the phrase in the context that suggests a rivalry focusing on tensions indicates that the **Cold War** can be observed in terms of later long-term rivalry but in the immediate post-abdication period, the **Russian Revolution** caused similar tensions rather than a formal state of war.\n\nTherefore, while no explicit war named follows the abdication, understanding the political environment suggests that the consequences of the **Russian Revolution** marked a significant state of rivalry between Russia and the UK, leading into the conditions that would eventually shape future conflicts, including the Cold War. \n\nShall we delve deeper into any of these historical aspects or confirm a final viewpoint?",

After Nicholas II abdicated on March 15, 1917, the political landscape shifted significantly due to the ongoing **Russian Revolution**, which led to substantial tensions between the two nations.\n\nThe context mentions that relations were strained due to this revolution, but it does not specify a formal war occurring as a result of the abdication. However, it does indicate that the relationship between Russia and the UK was characterized by rivalry during the **Cold War** (1947-1991). This rivalry, however, began considerably later than the abdication of Nicholas II. Therefore, while the Cold War represents a period of intense rivalry, it does not directly follow the abdication.\n\nInstead, the immediate consequence of the abdication was the Russian Revolution, which caused significant geopolitical tensions, but not a formal war between the two countries.\n\nThus, to clarify the answer: No specific war characterized the rivalry between Russia and the United Kingdom immediately after the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II; rather, it was the political turmoil resulting from the **Russian Revolution** that indicated significant strained relations.",

Following the abdication of Emperor Nicholas II in March 1917, it is essential to pinpoint the exact status of the Russia-United Kingdom relations during that period of upheaval. The context makes it clear that the Russian Revolution was a significant event leading to tensions, but it does not specify any formal war directly thereafter. Reflecting critically on this means concentrating on distinctions: although the Cold War is discussed later, its timing doesn\u2019t match the immediate aftermath of Nicholas II\u2019s abdication. Let\u2019s re-examine the connection between the abdication and the ensuing geopolitical atmosphere, focusing on the information provided.

We must identify the timeline of events, particularly noting that Nicholas II abdicated in March 1917, right before the Russian Revolution unfolded. It's clear from the context that while there were several periods of rivalry discussed, including the Cold War which occurred decades later, the immediate aftermath of the abdication was marked by the upheaval caused by the **Russian Revolution**, not a specific war. The question implies a search for a formal conflict, which my previous considerations failed to distinguish properly, as the tensions arose from revolutionary changes rather than from wartime hostilities. Thus, I'll clarify that although the Cold War is often referenced for its rivalry, it doesn't apply here, and we need to confirm that no formal war was ongoing after 1917 but rather a turbulent period of political change leading to intense diplomatic difficulties. Hence, we can conclude that while there was **no war directly**, the ensuing turmoil characterized by the **Russian Revolution** is what defined that rivalry period, not a conflict or battle.
