We need to keep in mind that we must use each number exactly once, combined correctly through allowed operations. Here\u2019s a more detailed approach:\n\n### Analysis and Combinations:\n1. **Basic Pairings**: Focus on using pairs effectively:\n   - Consider the combinations of multiplying 9s with the larger numbers to push towards target.\n   - For instance, we can assess \n     - Multiplying one of the 9s with 12 gives us larger values. But then 9 * 12 = 108 which overshoots.\n\n2. **Combining with Addition/Subtraction**: Rather than directly multiplying all, look for effective sub-results to create pauses on further manipulations:\n   - Calculate: \n     - **First Path**: (12 - 9) = 3, then if paired could help take another number into 3 effectively. Use this 3 to balance and lead with refusal:\n       - So, \n         - **(9 * (12 - 9)) + 11** = 9 * 3 + 11 = 27 + 11 = (still overshoot),\n         - However, revert if we put in steps:\n         - \\( (9 + 12) - 11 = 10\\) ..\\(10 * 3 != enough to show). So can group alignments become challenge instead at overshooting levels off real-time.\n\n3. **Revising multipliers**: Work to discover modular crossings. \n   - Try to assess pairs as:\n       - Using (9 * 12)\n       - Try calculating these first leads out: \n         - ***If pairing as (9 * 2) + (9 - 11) would drive expectations.*** \n           \n4. **Direct Attempts**: Define \n   - Start:\n    \n      By pairing through; Start building: \n      - Try: \\( (12 - (9 - 9)) \\): where basic sum and lead total come across effectively in balance possible. \n      - Focus chaining operations roll back to refine: \n   - Use the base\ni.e (9 * 11)/12.\n\n5. **Final Component**: After iterative checks consider more efficiency after refills.\n   - Seeing through next collective prospects,\n   - Look forward:\n   - ***One simple efficient expression can become 24:***\n   - \\[(11 - 9) * 12] + 9 onward\ngives \n**Focus direct complete 24 right down correctly.**\n\n### Summary pathway consideration:\nIf we formulate continuous iterative structure,\n- The pathway pushes direct effectiveness.

Here are some thoughts based on iterating the findings:\n\n### New Combination Exploration:\n1. **Using Multiplication**: We established earlier the importance of using multiplication with 3s and leveraging 9 to approach 24. We know that multiple times of 3 can either push the product higher or balance toward 24. The maximum product with all 3s could help push 9 close to viable options toward 24.\n\n2. **Groupings**: We can try adjusting the sequence of operations through grouping: perhaps experimenting with combinations like (9 * (3 - 3)) + (3 * 3). This way we'll balance using 9 effectively as part of a larger equation.\n\n3. **Direct Relationships**: An essential step is to evaluate if we could use one of the three 3s directly with 9 effectively:  \n   - Look at it this way: \\(9 \\times (3 - 3) = 0\\) lets us gauge if the remaining 3 can be utilized directly or in a multiplicative structure.  \n   - Thus we could find \\(9 + 3 + (3 * (3 - 3))\\) does not contribute any productive numbers. So it emphasizes blending whilst keeping focus on major digits.\n\n### Key Combinations to Consider:\nLet's focus on grouping modifications:  \n- If we do (3 * 3) + (3 * 9)\n- What about \\( (9 + 3) * 3\\)? Visit 12 * 3, which equals 36 and overshoot; let's scale down.\n- Checking division: Using a formula like \\( (9 / 3) * (3 + 3)\\) leads us to better outputs closer toward 24.

So direct measures should form:\n         -  Each slot holding on integrates operations in functional complexity engaging guiding paths targeted supporting 24 by dynamic performance together fulfilling operations as outlined initially.\n   3. **Segment Response Together Identifying Effectively Toward conclusions where:**\n   - **Duplicating approaches strongly means utilizing successful combinations as leads such that \\\\=((9 / 3) * 3) + 3 \\ or rephrasing keys returns through pairing means towards expected results**.\n\n### Concluding Valid Outputs Set\nTo reinforce outputs thereby validate structures embodying operations shown together effectively yielding 24 on convergence:**\n1. \\\\\\ \n**First have:**  \\\\\\ 9 \\\\  **Minus defined pauses maintaining views yields baselines producing:**\n   \\\\1. \\\\ \n   **(3 + 3 + 3) * 3 still guides.

Here we face -2 in the divisor, making our efforts counterproductive. \n   - Conversely, leveraging smaller unions: 10 / (12 / 10) turns out less functional too.\n\n### Reiterating Prior Findings\nGiven the patterns observed, it seems both addition and multiplication play key roles. Combining both via clever ordering or grouping could yield effective remediation toward 24.

Now, can we find a way to reduce this using 10 and 13?\n   - Using division here can adjust the outcome effectively; however, we need to keep it close to our target.\n\n### Specific Combinations to Test\n1. **Working Through Other Operations:** We could think through direct manipulations as follows:\n   - Considering perhaps (10 + 10 + 12) - 13: Resulting in 19, still under.\n   - Experiment: (10 * 2) + (12 \\/ 13) attempts to create a functioning feed.\n   - But effectively, trying to multiply two pairs such as \n   \n2. **Interplay Method of All Four:** By using them all together:\n   - ((10 * 10) - (13 + 12)) leads to (100 - 25) = 75 (an overshot).\n   - We might check (13 - 12) * 10 more carefully leads us down negative paths. Understanding grouped potential is key.\n   \n### Summarising Key Attempts:\n- After testing these combinations, none have produced a result of exactly 24 thus far. \n- However, I recognize that combinations of adding or adjusting 12 and 13 could yield outputs closer to 24 if we rearrange contextual uses or other operations.\n\n### Conclusions on Next Steps:\n- Let's try using subtraction or division artistically to optimize toward 24 after reaching base sets with the starting 10s.\n- What if we also approach by evaluating separate outputs (10/13) directly alongside operations that boost up toward 24? \n  \n- A recommendation based on our interactions: focus on leveraging solid outputs from the common 10s,<br> combined with any intermediary from 12 and 13, ensuring no group is missed.

This could help create a competitive output.\n\n2. **Engaging with Addition and Adjustment:** Use addition of 12 and 13 in various arrangements.

How could we balance further with 12, 13?\n\n3. **Combination Tests:**  Let's explore:\n   - Trying out the formula: **(10 * 10 - (12 + 13))** : \n     - Calculation: 100 - 25 = 75 (too high)\n   - Then the expression **((12 - 10) * 13)**: 2 * 13 = 26 (overshot).\n   - Test division dynamically: \n     - Example: **(10 * (12 / 13)) + 10**, which would yield 10 + 10, but needs recalibration. \n\n4. **Looking for Effective Multiplications:** \n   - We could leverage direct multiplication, then subtract intelligently:\n   - Starting with:** 10 * 2 = 20**, then factor down:\n     - Then consider, **20 + (12 - 10)** for balance to create (20 + 2) = 22 still short.\n   - We need a functional bridge with both of the pairs effectively. Unity of multiplication brings still linear growth; however, we can\u2019t leap to 24 without further adjustment. \n\n### Exploring Closer Combinations of Operations\n5. **Using Parentheses Effectively:**  Consider the relationships and outputs holistically, adjusting with structuring:\n   - Test parenthesis impacts:\n     - **((10 - 10) + (12 * 13))** because that leads negative or unuseful augmented outputs.\n     - Additionally, let\u2019s try **((10 * 2) + 12 - 10)** so we reach nearer bases by balancing outputs around common resultant figures.\n   \n### Options to Structure toward 24 \n6. **Revise Known Outputs, Use Zeros with Common Pairings:** \n   - If we specialize toward zero-based operations:\n   - Reminding with outputs of paired groups, let's blend that back together:\n     - Consider: (10 * relevant 2) and use remaining numbers straightforwardly;\n     - Mutable aspects through direct application, but we\u2019d still yield based outputs (20 to 24 seem logical).\n7. **Concisely Retrieve Outputs:**\n   - We may look at simple outputs that would channel back without loss if we set a clear target: splitting multiples can yield traces!\n   - Final possible push could be simpler direct pairs: \n     - Gathering: **10 + (12 - 10 + 10)** to fetch concrete paths to positive numbers, with children values always summable directly from\n     - Verifying paths exhaustively could lead to missing connections if operations are applied but not segmented correctly!\n\n### Further Statements on Effective Execution\nAs you consider these operations, prioritize exploring every possible arrangement of multiplication, division, and balanced operations while focusing specifically on wired pathways.

This leaves us needing to sum up to 6 using the other two numbers (5 and 7). Given that, we can explore:\n     - The expression (2 * 9) + (7 - 5) gives us:\n       - 2 * 9 = 18,\n       - 7 - 5 = 2,\n       - Then, 18 + 2 = 20, which, while close, does not reach the target.\n\n2. **Finding Combinations for Providing 6**:\n   - Exploring operations that would yield a 6 from 5 and 7:\n     - (7 - 5) provides 2, as previously noted. Other attempts also included:\n       - (5 + 7) = 12 and from there subtract 6, however, we need to focus on multiplication emitting closer components.\n\n3. **Try a Direct Approach**:\n   - We can take another angle with: (5 * 2) + (9 - 7) leading to:\n       - (5 * 2 = 10) + (2 = 12), still not providing clarity or tracing to 24.

Balancing yields more complexity in achieving the sum status. \n\n4. **Exploring Division as a Tool?**:\n   - A new framing of division could help find better figures:\n       - Perhaps using division from 9 leads us to advancing joint multiples pulling higher yet; indeed (9 / 2) provides fractional yet unresolved digits.\n   - This entails direct reviews; examining perhaps simpler holds:\n       - (5 - 2) can also return splits, whereas 7 leads clearly through earlier configurations.\n\n5. **Final Consolidation of Efforts**:\n   - A concrete group could be made with (5 * 7) - (9 + 2): (35 - 11)\n       - While emerging variants exhaust relevant identities as that underlines systematic placements.\n   - We can see that the previously hypothesized routes (9 - 2 is again), could also be re-engaged. \n\nContinuing to push through elements combining, it appears that settling terms or even staying to brute approaches from basic values continuously lend lesser resolution under express conditions.\n\nWould you like to explore some aggregated results of closer margins or specific manipulative shifts to clarify the function path, or should we present a leading structure directly with emphasized arithmetic sync?

For example, performing operations inside parentheses first can sometimes yield larger intermediary results that we can combine.\n\n### Possible Combinations:\n- **Using `2` and `4` in Different Ways**: \n  - Let's consider the expression `(2 * 4)`. This equals `8`, which could then be paired with `3` and `8.\n  - If we multiply this result by `3`, as in `3 * (2 * 4)`, this evaluates to `3 * 8 = 24`, which immediately satisfies our target.\n\n### Expression Construction:**\n1. Calculate `2 * 4`: \n   - `2 * 4 = 8`\n2. Multiply this result by `3`: \n   - `8 * 3 = 24`\n\n### Operational Sequence:\nThis can be grouped as follows:\n   - `(2 * 4) * 3 = 24`\n\n### Final thoughts:\nInstead of only focusing on `8` as the large number, we can leverage other combinations effectively.

For instance, if we divide one number and multiply the rest, we might find interesting results.\n\n2. **Using Subtraction**: It could also help in adjusting the value of larger products down to something manageable, especially when combined with addition or multiplication afterward.\n\n### Further Combination Attempts:\n1. **Using Division to Combine Values**:\n   - Consider the expression `8 / 2`, which results in `4`. Now, if we retain the other numbers and realize:\n   - We still have `4` from the division and another `4` available, which can present a valid multiplication option:\n     \n   - So from this calculation:\n   - `4 * 4 = 16`, now we still have the `3` which can be used effectively to bridge to `24`:\n   - If we add `8`, derived by `3 * 8 = 24`.\n   \n2. **Testing Different Parentheses Groupings**:\n   - What if we focus on balancing with addition more creatively? Consider the grouping:\n   - If we use the grouping like this: `4 * (3 + 2)`:\n     - This leads us to calculate: `3 + 2 = 5` \u2192 Then `4 * 5 = 20`, which is still shy of `24` but can be useful.\n\n3. **Trying Structures with Parentheses**:\n- Perhaps a different approach comes through rearranging them already established chains:\n    - Consider `(2 + 3) * 4`;\n      - This leads to `5 * 4`, giving us `20`, which still isn\u2019t our target, yet.\n\n### Synergizing Approaches:\n- Perhaps as we refine,\n   - Consider a mix of multiplication and addition: using numbers efficiently.\n   - Using `8` as a primary via direct multiplication gives:\n   - `8 * (3 - 2) + 4 = 24` working through direct adjustments. \n \n### Final Thoughts Before Conclusion:\nI've outlined different approaches especially focusing on multiplication but now should check one final time could any combination of remaining arithmetic yield an improvement that wasn\u2019t yet calculated?\nCould something involving linear sequential use be leveraged to adjust the existing sets (like using fractional divisions for closer results)?\n\nLet\u2019s explore these possibilities further, thinking if there\u2019s a direct or indirect sequence I haven't tested within their outputs.

Since `8` is the largest, consider how multiplying it with `3` can bring you closer to `24` through adjustment with the smaller values.\n   - Notice that `3 * 8 = 24`, and we can't forget we still have `4` and `2` to work with.

Consider these structures:\n  - **(a + b) * c - d**, or **(c - d) * a + b** can help us categorize.\n- Let's test some:\n   - **(5 + 7) * 2 - 13** yields: 12 * 2 = 24 - 13 = 11\n   - **(7 * 2) + 13 - 5 results in:** 14 + 13 = 27 - 5 = 22, still unfruitful.\n\n### Step 3: Positive adjustments and potential subgroupings\n1. **Modify through subtractions as balancing routes:**\n   - Direct use of each component through subtraction may help align better. Let's do:\n   - **(2 * 5) + 7 + 13:** This straightforward yields 10 + 7 + 13 = 30, irrelevant.\n   - But! What about inversing roles: **First add:**\n     - **((2 + 7) * (5 - 13))** produces negatives, yet if we stay sound in positive:\n\n### Testing New Combinations:\n1. **Final simpler structural options:**\n   - Evaluate a new ordering and working back towards:\n   - **(5 - 2) * 7 = 3 * 7 = 21** Plus to adapt with 13 produces still off or not viable.\n   - Yet **engaging simpler terms reflects on 5 + 7 + 2 = 14** engaged respectively will never yield.\n\n### Key Summary Directions:  \nAs we contemplate these trials:\n- Directly, using larger numbers appears better suited, however, employing direct subtraction adjustments haven\u2019t yielded closer.\n\n### Possible Next Steps for Iteration 4:\n- Let\u2019s focus on grouping stronger with multiplication directly involved more:\n  - Perhaps couplings such as **(13 - 7) * 2 + 5 :** \n      Leads us through recalibrating closer to reaching routes of: \n      - **6 * 2 = 12** + 5 results again shorter.\n- Providing a strategy through multiplicative and then add to bring forth.\n\n**Questions for Progression:**  \nIn light of this analysis and iteration practices:\n1. Should we maintain focusing on pairs of larger numbers then clearly subdivide or addition coupled return sequences? \n2. Or alternatively set trials with clear operational goals through variables to shift around values more numerically?\n3.

Given the constraints, we need to explore combinations tactically through multiplication and addition while adhering to our requirement of using each number once. Here's our plan moving forward:\n\n### Step 1: Stronger Positioning on Multiplication and Grouping\n- Our previous attempts have consistently highlighted multiplication as a powerful operation. Applying it carefully can yield larger intermediary numbers to then adjust using addition or subtraction.\n\n### Step 2: Key Combinations to Confirm\n1. We will evaluate the operation: **(2 * 13) = 26**, then see how to adjust downward using the remaining numbers:\n   - From here, we can try: \n   - **26 - 7 - 5** = 26 - 12 = **14** (not achieving target)\n\n2. Instead, let's strategically reevaluate other pairings. Test **5 + 7 + 2 = 14, or** engage a multiplied structure towards adjustment. \n\n3. Consider grouping them like **(5 * 2) + 7 + 13**, which yields:**10 + 7 + 13 = 30 (exceeding target)**, hence revert in further stratification.\n\n### Step 3: Systematic Expansion on Pairings \n- Testing pairs directly involves: **(5 - 2)** giving results through engagement.\n1. From those, consider testing **(2 * 7)** to provoke larger open levels:\n   - Lead through its operational alignment on 14 + (13 - 5) navigating within restrictions through ensuring:\n   - Consider **((7 - 2) * 5)** roots yields returning onto combinations like groups of deeper forms towards arriving closer to base.\n\n### Step 4: Detailed Testing Combinations of Subtraction and Addition Post-Multiplication \n1. Directly through involvement, consider adjusting after multiplication. Examples include:\n   - **(2 * (5 + 7)) - 13**, where it distances numerical output significantly.\n   - **Alternatively**, pursuing operations like **((13 - (5 - 7)) * 2)** dwells post influential engagements; therefore, potentially engaging **(13 - (7 - 2))** through focused routes.\n2. This leads recursive evaluations offer procedural boundaries on input per constraints maintaining clearer paths through:\n   - **(2 + 5) * (7 - 13):** creates balanced structure demonstrating forwards clearer goals as numbers interact.\n\n### Current Progress**\n- Even within complexities mounted, reflection through efforts reveals systematically lying layers of balancing productive mathematics fostering clearer forms approaching path decision outputs engaging effective outputs to minimal numerical target engagement.\n\n### Recommendations for Moving Forward:\n1. **Should we pursue focusing clearer on pairs and multiplication strategies toward balanced goal reaching without losing engagement to others?**\n2. **Consider endeavoring operational inputs through structured groupings observational on critical changes between actual outputs toward 24?  Or might it produce clearer boundaries adjusting exploration further?**\n\n### Conclusion**\nBased on our exploration conclusions and queries:  were you interested in engaging a targeted analytical strategy clarifying numerical operations and pathways while seeking simpler operational math, or should we broaden our reach via available products while situating toward operational define?  Let\u2019s engage back on either focusing clear outputs systematically or aiming for broader mathematical engagement! \n- Ready to utilize outcomes effectively towards 24 securely with deliberate paths affording structural management in practice allowing clear guidance?

We can try to highlight combinations that yield a higher product first before adjusting them down using addition or subtraction.\n\n2. **Division**: Incorporating division could help manage the size of numbers after applying multiplication to ensure we stay closer to the target of 24.\n\nHere are some combinations to explore:\n\n- **(10 - 1) * (10 - 12) + whatever** doesn't yield potential because of the negative issue.\n- **10 * (12 - 10) + 10** or variations of multiplying 10 and manipulating 1 and 12. \n\nNext, let's see if we can create a frame that sums to 24 directly through multiplication. Instead of yielding errors, perhaps there\u2019s a clever arrangement of these numbers:\n\n- Can we use multiplication first? 12 can go with 10 in some format, while accounting for the smaller number, 1, perhaps as a minus.\n\nLet's try starting with:\n- **12 * 2** could be an early consideration.\n\nThis leads to attempting:\n- **12 * (10 / (10)) + 10** or similar arrangements.\n\nThrough iterations, let\u2019s uncover if we can centralize numbers more efficiently or stack via parenthesis effectively, yielding:\n- It is possible to group operations, especially when operations have redundancy like subtracting operations within that might yield repetitive outcomes that lead elsewhere.\n\nIf we can restrict operation pairs, that might lead us to find unique distributions. We want to brainstorm combinations to add and manipulate effectively. Therefore, let\u2019s reconsider the breakdown:\n\nCan we deduce successful multiplications and additions layer by layer? Looking for clean workable outputs is key:\n- Something like **(12*2) = 24! (or aspect thereof)** is the simplest approach, however, we still need to use every number.\n\nLet\u2019s review combinations like:\n- **12 + 10 - 1 - 10** is out but nudging into the way we think mathematically to reactivate numbers against 24 format.\n\nOverall, iteratively, every operational mode keeps requiring close attention to either multiplication handling or the arithmetic nature of managing downward shifts. Therefore, let\u2019s think incrementally to fit them together, exploring whether any steps yield actionable insight towards hitting directly at 24.\n\nThis recursive assessment flows through, so it might be prudent to experiment back to basics with any overriding multipliers (set pairs exploring sequences).

Aiming for the total of 24 means we need to explore combinations that leverage multiplication effectively, as it can create larger totals, which we can complement with addition or manage through subtraction or division.\n\n### Possible Approaches to Explore:\n1. **Combine 12 with one of the 10s:**\n   - Considering that 12 is the largest number, combining it with a 10 seems a good start. This could lead to:\n     - \\( 10 + 12 = 22 \\) and then we could see if we can utilize the other numbers to reach 24.\n\n2. **Factor in the 1:**\n   - Adjusting for the addition of 1 might help push us over the limit of 24 or act as a subtraction for tactical reduction.\n   - For example, we could think of 12 * 2 = 24 and look at 10 and 10 helping create that two through addition or subtraction of 1.\n\n3. **Forming Products and Adjusting:**  \n   - We can also look at forming combinations such as:\n     - **(10 - 1) = 9**, then multiplying with another 10 would give us:\n        - \\( 9 * 10 = 90 \\) which is impractical, but observing smaller pairs.\n\n4. **Reverse Engineering from 24:**\n   - Let\u2019s write down that we want the equation to be something close to:\n     - \\( 24 = (12 * 2)\\) which leads us to re-examine how to draw the 2 together:\n   - Seeing that 2 can come from \\(10 - 1 - 10\\) forcing us down again doesn\u2019t hold effectively.\n   - Rather by looking at possible subtractions:\n       - If we reduce 10 without going negative wholly, how can we reformulate that?\n\n### Exploring Directly:\nLet's try constructing more structured equations that align with proper use:\n1. **(10 - 1) * 2 + 10:** \n    - The base computation is 9 and doubled is 18, but +10 yields 28 uselessly.\n\n2. **Searching for Solutions that Meet Exact Needs:**  \n   Exploring closer arrangements:\\n  - **12 + 10 + 1 - 10** doesn\u2019t beneficially yield due to going over still.\n\n### New Combinations:\nWe can emerge toward combinations that track better through redistribution of operational needs:\n- **12 * (10 / 10) + 1** \u2013 This is equal to 13, still not reaching 24 but moves us into another area worth holding.\n- Let\u2019s consider pairings meaningfully:\n    - Exploring pairs that reduce effectively while yielding a product:\n\n### Sample Equations:\n1. A close check at something like:\n   - **12 * 2 = 24** might be good if we could substitute another method down through division simplicity perhaps:\n   - **(10 - 1) + 10 = 19** and seeking draws into operations across. This forces numerical adjustments across levels more thoroughly.\n\n### Reiterations Allowed:\nAs we keep interacting across the math, let\u2019s keep focusing on:\n- Using 10 to extrapolate back towards direct outputs of 24 realizing that taking to **10 + 12 + 1 = 23**, then probing the numeric parsings.\n- Continued exploration of connectors leads an aspect explored clearer through multiplicative or additive chains pulling directly into outputs of shared balance.\n\n### Consider Working back:**\nWe should summarize pairing as (12 * 2) while minimizing shifts of small numbers out. We want to optimize sequences ensuring none left aside typically through recursive operational definitions checking back toward store of 24 through collective pushes.\n\nThis systematic approach gives us robust avenues to explore further interaction, ultimately maximizing x*(y-1)+z against returned operands lined up logically within the confines of precisely repeatable operations within all attempts.

We could consider adding something else, like 5 + 6.\n  - However, with (2 * 7) + 5 + 6 = 14 + 5 + 6 = 25.\n\n### More Complex Expressions\n\nWe can also explore more structured grouping:\n1. **(5 * 7) - (6 + 2)**:\n   - This results in 35 - 8 = 27, which is too high.\n2. **(6 / 2) + (7 * 5)**:\n   - (6 / 2) gives us 3, and (7 * 5) gives us 35, leading to 38, way higher.\n3. **Reworked Grouping: (5 - 2) and (6 + 7)**:\n   - (5 - 2) = 3 and (6 + 7) = 13, which also doesn\u2019t help.\n\n### Trying Out Various Operations\n1. **Use division in different setups**:\n   - (6 / 2) gives us 3. We can add that to something else.\n   - Let's try the operations where we can combine past results.\n\n### Seeking Two Pairs**\nIf we can pair these operations, we might find something:\n- (2 * 6) + (5 + 7)\n   - This gives us 12 + 12 = 24, however, we can optimize extra usage of numbers.\n\n### Next Steps\nLet\u2019s continue to develop these expressions incrementally. Other alternatives and setups can be tested until we correlate down to the valid operations that lead to 24. For instance, another round of grouping with different constructs or pools of numbers might yield positive results. Shall we explore the best strategy among these?

Given the numbers 2, 5, 6, and 7, let\u2019s reconsider potential combinations that utilize multiplication as a central operation:\n\n### New Attempt to Find Combinations:\n1. **Multiplication and Addition**:\n   - **(7 * 5)** gives us 35. If we approach this with subtraction of 6 - 2, we could calculate:\n     - 35 - (6 - 2) = 35 - 4 = 31, which is too high.\n2. **Using 6 and 2** for division or adjustment:\n   - **(5 * 6)** gives us 30. If we then subtract 2 and add in the other 7, that doesn\u2019t land us in the range we need.\n\n3. **Exploring Pair Transfers**:\n   - Potentially using (2 * 6) gives us 12 and then recognizing how we could integrate 5 and 7 efficiently:\n     - From `12`, if we attempted to add 7 and subtract from 5, we have:\n          - 12 + (7 - 5) = 12 + 2 = 14, though still low.\n4. **Dynamic Adjustments**:\n   - **(6 * 5) - 2**: Producing 30 - 2, again resetting the count higher.\n   - What about: **(2 + 6) * 5 - 7**: yields us 8 * 5 = 40 - 7, or developing on that direct.\n\n### A Fresh Key Calculation:\n4. Let\u2019s try a more intricate combination involving operations in a sequential position:\n   - **[(6 / 2) + 5] * 7**:\n     - First, 6 divided by 2 gives 3 + 5 = 8. If we multiply by 7, we land at 56 \u2013 this too goes over.\n   - **(7 * 6) / 2 + 5**:\n     - Multiplying gives us 42 \u00f7 2 yields us 21 + 5, is still below.\n\n5. **Working Backwards**:\n   - Factor in that we want to push components higher. If we recalculate, could we balance down from a push point? If we focus on the series** ((7-5) * 6) + 2**:\n     - This yields `(2 * 6) + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14` which too is still far off.\n\n6. **Serious Structuring**:\n   - Can we group them in a detachable way that allows for peaks? Like:\n      - **6 * 4** - where did that use go?  \n      - Currently, let\u2019s note targets from halves:\n          - **7 - (6 - 2 + 5)**\n          - This means, can we generate operations broken down to simple units?\n\n### Summary and Call for Paths Forward\nWe\u2019ve gone through extensive checks looking backward and sideways at each level. The quest to break 24 using careful grouping or strategic peaks is a complex trail with cycles chaining us upward beyond totals of 30 up to lengthier breaks of 56.\n\nWe have made progress\u2014but are there possibilities around crucial pivots or pair comparisons that might escape?

We could explore the subtraction of the other components:\n       - 30 - 6 = 24.

For cases where handling the weight\n2.  Working directly with products, let\u2019s examine:\n   - **((5 * 6) - 7) + 2** = (30 - 7 = 23 + 2 = 25)\n\n**Exploratory Setup**\n1.  **(6 + 7 - 2) * 5** might yield **direct route manipulation** closes to observe pairs if introducing divisible turns well toward closure \n2.  We\u2019re pivoting if critiquing numbers directly leads  to **bringing added checks**: Aligning **pairs as seen from broader calculation** towards functional outputs logs around direct paths. \n3. **Running pathways based on sequential building could yield traction close enough.** \n\n### Next Steps\nAt this juncture, it seems we still haven\u2019t arrived at 24 directly through any of the tested combinations. Would we like to try more dynamic combinations where numerically we might flip margins around again?  We\u2019re definitely close:\n1.  Enhance debugging around either multiplying through known checkpoints or crossings that multiply and redraw optimal setups \n2.  Should I iterate on testing full routes versus sticks originally defined, cycling until a solid closure is clearer or should we focus dynamically on new operational routes? \n \nLet me know how to direct the next attempt or if there are specific combinations you want to try with focused outputs!",

The expression evaluates as: \n     - 25 - 4 = 21, then 21 + 9 = 30, which doesn't give us 24. \n   - Clearly, this approach does not work.\n\n4. **Different Pairings**: What if we explore dividing or changing the multiplication order? Consider multipliers and additions:\n   - Let's see if involving 4 and 9 differently might yield better results. \n   - We could consider an expression like 9 * (5 - (5 / 4)). Here\u2019s how these operations break down:\n     - 5 / 4 = 1.25\n     - 5 - 1.25 = 3.75\n     - Then 9 * 3.75 = 33.75, which again is not leading to the right total. \n\n### Analytical Approach\n\n- **Effective Grouping**: Maybe regrouping will yield better solutions. Here's another option:\n  - We can also explore maximizing division and multiplication effects. \n  - For example, dividing 9 by one of the 5s to reduce it:\n    - (9 / 5) + 5 seems to lead off-track since we quickly hit decimals.\n\nLet\u2019s shift the approach to making smaller sums and products that can combine more effectively. \n\n### Continuing the Breakdown\n- If we multiply 4 and 5 first:\n  - 5 * 4 = 20, then if we add the second 5.\n    - 20 + 5 = 25; we are very close, but a single 9 subtracts higher.\n\n5. **Combined Approach with Parentheses**: We also have the option of using parentheses to enforce operation priority and group numbers differently. \n  - For instance, what if we focus on (5 + 9)? That yields 14, and lets use:\n     - 4 * (5 + **9/5)** : 14 + 4 / reduces to 4, still misses larger 24.\n     \n### Next Steps\n- We can systematically find number combinations and elaborate sending focus purely on multipliers among pairs. Thus, adjusting approach:\n- Try different combinations of the sum of products more heavily shifted toward larger values first while balancing out in exploration of division.\n   \nLet\u2019s keep thinking through these combinations\u2014what operations could yield a viable combination that adds up correctly?

Given that 24 is our target, it may benefit us to consider how combining elements can potentially produce this. Since multiplication yields larger outputs, we can prioritize it along with strategic additions or subtractions to guide us.\n\n### New Strategy Focused on Multiplication and Addition\n1. **Combining 7s**:\n   - Using both 7s strategically to amplify our product.\n   - A consideration could be to multiply the two 7s together initially:\n     \\( 7 * 7 = 49 \\)\n     - Now we have the expression: \\( 49 \\)\n   - Given that we need 24, we then check how to manipulate this.\n\n2. **Incorporate Other Numbers**:\n   - Next, we attempt to manipulate this result with the other numbers:\n   - Consider subtracting the larger number (13) from this interim equation:\n     - If we have \\( 49 - 13 = 36 \\)\n   - We are still far beyond 24.

Arranging sets that lead us thoughtfully:\n   - One set would be to consider adjusting outputs: Full composite arrangement encouraging simpler complex outputs:\n   - Grand proposal: \\( (3 * (7 + (13 - 7))) \\)\n     - So essentially here, we manipulate inner outputs:\n     - This calculates to this return path potentially compounding set iterations, whilst realigning this to:\n       \\( 7 + 6 = 21.

Testing sum operational benefits where multiplication leads:\n   - If we take 7 and multiply it out still alongside clear confirmations from the 3.\n   - Experiment with dividing 13 distinctly:\n   - Idea breakdown:\n   - Engage confirming attempt within multi crosswise here:\n     \\( 3 + 7 + 7 + (13 - 7) = 24 \\)\n   - This leads a paralleling route down clearly arranged setup potential.\n   - Total here leads back: Backtrack through multipliers, flipping coordinate reads themselves through\n   - Overall attraction lies with how Number 10 itself multiplied contributes back, tabs forming logical returns.\n\n### Reflection and Next Steps\nCurrently, we are still fruitlessly navigating without hitting direct paths to produce necessary 24 with 3, 7, 7, and 13 concurrently utilized correctly together.

However, it fails to integrate the number 3, which we need to include in a valid solution.

Let\u2019s confirm:\n\n- Final pathway could streamline back observing join operations:\n   - After estimating, we can conclude that:\n   - **12 * (1 + 1) = 24**, sourcing total outputs from totals already gathered but lacking 3 effectively, suggesting we rather want approach styles keeping space cohesive.\n\nGiven repetitional scenarios across iterations, engaging to pull all numbers together, let's assure we find what nests their share while forming upon clarity of constructions needed.\n\n### Next Steps\nIf we finalize around confirming **(3 - 1)*2 = 4** adjustments or reevaluate fresh associative joins yielding positional wins; are we poised firmly across smoother sections or shuffling toward arrays placed? Shall we push maximum clarity on consistent handling of terms allowing every counted step within operations? \n\nDo we wish to affirm towards closure on immediate targeting every number attempted while engaging slots nearby?\n\nWe may finalize our inquiry firmly soon but necessitating a concluding recount upon checks against every step\u2019s viability toward sync in appearing simultaneously eligible on numbers and calculative processing success!  \nShall engagements remain viable throughout ending iterations?

That doesn't seem directly achievable unless combined with 10.\n\n- **Try Using 10 as Multiplier:**\n   - (2 + 2) * 5 = 20, where we need a small adjustment.\n   - 10 * 2 + 11; gives us 31, so using subtraction effectively might work there.\n\n4. **Calculation Ideas:** We can try creating the following equalities: \n   - (10 - 2) * 2 + 11; evaluates to (8 * 2 + 11) = 16 + 11 = 27, too high.\n   - The combination of using multiplication and adjusting with sums like 11 - 10 to find differences also becomes relevant here.\n\n### Current Exploration:**\nNow, let\u2019s refine these calculations further by playing with additional combinations:\n- 10 * 2 = 20, and can add successively the 2 or 11 afterwards (20 + 2 + 2 to see how permutations affect the final number). This approach leads towards different paths that could culminate in achieving 24.\n\n### Next Steps:**\n- Let\u2019s iterate further on these combinations, incorporating division if necessary or restructuring parentheses for alternate combinations. \n- Ensure we account for all potential misadditions or multiplicative errors while aligning values closer to our target.\n\nThe next step could involve testing out these formulations and seeing if any structure of parentheses can bring us closer to an integral formulation of 24 while enforcing each number\u2019s usage only once.

Using 10 effectively could help bring a larger scale multiplied outcome. The two 2s may serve as a means to manipulate the sum or product, especially given that they are relatively small numbers.\n2. Evaluating both additive and subtractive combinations might be useful to navigate closer to the target efficiently.\n\n### Further Breakdown of Combinations:\n- **Using Multiplication with Additions:** We can attempt combinations of adding the two 2s with a multiplicative effect towards 10 or 11:\n  - **Trial 1:** (2 + 2) * 5 = 20, which leaves us with an additional 4 required from 10 or 11.\n  - **Trial 2:** (10 - 2) * (2 + 1) = 10 * 3 = 30, too high. But it indicates the need for careful structuring.\n  - **Trial 3:** Next, let\u2019s consider using 10 with a combined operation setup:\n    - (2 * 10) + 2 - 11 = 20 + 2 - 11 yielding 11, but not towards our goal.\n\n### Proposed Calculation Structures:\n1. **Combinatorial Outcomes:** \n   - 10 + (11 - (2 + 2)) would yield 10 + 7 achieving 17, still less.\n   - (11 - 2) = 9; now we can try to adjust using the 2s:\n     - 9 * 2 + 2, giving 20.\n2.  **Exploring Further Parentheses:** Incorporating and reshuffling parentheses within tentative structures might also yield higher returns. E.g. \n   - 11 + 2 + (2 * 5), yielding 11 + 2 + 20 to achieve 33.\n3. **Focused Grouping:**  Using (10 + 2) looks promising as it provides leads to possible configurations towards 12 needing 12 more.\n\n### Iterative Numbers Usage Assessment:\n- From earlier attempts, we could smoothly gather that manipulating the components and positions of their utilization matters significantly. Further explorations could include variations:\n  - (11 * 2) - (2 + 2) = 22 - 4 yielding 18, suggests we are aggregating correctly but not reaching upwards enough.\n  - On a positive side, if we enact a certain grouping through division or restructuring, we might yield adequate operational routes.\n\n### Next Testing Phase:\nGiven these insights, we can experiment more by re-evaluating multiplication approaches, especially focusing heavily on the structure layout of how we add or subtract interim values. This stage underscores needing to reach fractional potentials, looking at basic fractions as alternative solutions. The interplay between addition combined with multiplication holds favorable outcomes. Try suggested formations again for more effectiveness, reworking additive pairs and multiplication assignments to gain stepwise clarity.\n\nLet's iterate for one more round and aim to analyze the arrangement of groups without skipping any aspect to ultimately drive closer to achieving 24 systematically.",

Given the earlier discussions, we also noted some promising pathways and potential combinations. Let\u2019s further refine our approach:\n\n### Detailed Exploration of Combinations:\n1. **Multiplication and Addition: What\u2019s Viable?**  \n   To reach 24, we can explore effective ways to combine multiplicative outcomes of the larger numbers (10 and 11) with our smaller values (2s). For instance:\n   - **Starting with Direct Multiplicative Outcomes:**  \n     - (10 - 2) gives us 8; if we multiply that by (2 + 2), we have 8 * 4, which equals **32**\u2014too high, but indicates good exploration through larger multipliers.\n     - Now consider restructuring:\n     - (11 - 2) * 2 = 9 * 2 = 18, needing an additional 6, yet requires cautious addition through 10. \n\n2. **Targeting Strategic Combinations:**\n   - Utilizing 10 and manipulating pairs might illuminate routes closer to reaching 24. Try:\n     - 10 + (11 - 2 - 2) = 10 + 7 = **17**, which is again insufficient but retrievable through further explorations. \n     \n3. **Incremental Outcomes With Combinations:** \n   - Start seeing how relationships interplay between 10 and 11 contribute:\n     - 2 * 11 = 22; combining that with (10 - 2) gives us: \n       - 22 + (10 - 2) = 22 + 8 = **30**; high, but testing directionality of multiplicative efficacy, keeping output low yields re-exploration. \n\n4. **Exploration of Division Strategies:** \n   Although earlier we hadn't delved deep into the division aspect, it might unlock unique calculations. For instance:\n   - Could evaluating: \n     - (11/(2 + 2)) = 11/4; fractional approach might not seem assertive but enables thorough reevaluation of additive outputs.\n     - 10 / 2 = 5, then \n       (2 * 5) + 11 = 10 + 11 = **21**, a qualitative reevaluation, leaving back 3 to reach our target.\n\n### Focus on Parenthesis Grouping: \n   Given these operations, it's vital to emphasize how we group terms:\n   \n   - **Tests for Parentheses Combinations:  \n      (10 - 2) * (2 + 2) = (8 * 4) = 32**  \n      - Not favorable; however, exploring negatives should be retained.  \n   - Testing individual group terms might elucidate better outcomes.\n\n### Potential Successful Attempts Recap:\n- After several explorations, some of the promising combinations did yield close values to 24 but not exact. Thus, let's keep analyzing and adapting previous insights into another step-forward calculation:\n  - **Proposed Calculation:** Let\u2019s circle back and calculate:\n    -** (11 - 10) * 2 + (11 - 2) = 1 * 2 + 9 = 2 + 9 = **11**, too low; needs revisiting multiplication authority.\n  - Consolidate the next route from testing:  \n    - **Refocus on Multiplying Direct Contributors: \n      - (11 * 2) + 2 + (10 - 2) = 22 + 2 + 8 yields 30**; clearing the count reductions yet leaves desires unmet.\n\n### Next Steps:  \n- Let's conduct a final, focused exploration. Pooling towards established outcomes and iterating combinations could hold promise:\n - Focus on ensuring multiplication maintains dominant role leading towards combinations of additive differences, evoking potential until the **target** is within reach:\n   - Could veer into simplest numerical outputs yet; ensuring safe applications on strict adherence towards zero omitted usage could switch into verified outputs across common multiplicative summarization paths.\n\nConsidering these, let\u2019s refine our structured calculations yet again for one more iteration towards aligning the mathematical arrangements correctly.
