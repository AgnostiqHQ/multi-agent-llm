Given that we haven't found a valid expression yet, we can explore combinations that multiply the higher numbers to get closer to 24, then adjust with addition or subtraction of the lower numbers. Focus on breaking down the larger numbers, perhaps consider: (Some combination of the numbers giving us a larger base to work from) while still ensuring we use all four numbers once.
