Let's reconsider the grouping to maximize our potential:\n- (12 - 10) * (10 + 1) = (2) * (11) = 22 which is still less than 24.\n\nWe need to iterate to find a correct combination. \nAfter different iterations, one can arrive at:\n((10 - 1) * 10) - 12 = 24,\n\nThus, the expression is: (10 - 1) * 10 - 12.\nThe final answer expression will yield 24.",
