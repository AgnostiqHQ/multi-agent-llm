Now we have the result of 24, but we still need to account for the remaining numbers, which are 1 and 11. We notice that since we have already reached 24, we can think of using 1 and 11 for subtraction. \n3. If we now subtract 11 from 1, we get a negative number, which does not affect our path.\n4. Therefore, we can write an expression to combine all operations as follows: (12 + 12) + (1 - 11).

A valid approach is by considering that: 12 - 4 = 8, and then taking the other 4 from that directly yielding to interpose effective placement of the 9 accordingly, and retaining realistic outcomes; however, this equation derivatively which is more direct hitting through claims of 24 would be so arranging: (4 * (12 - 9) + 4), where substituting operations smartly and checking through fluctuations reaffirms targeting deeply around sets without iterative losses.
