A spiral, usually three dimensional - the word 'SCOOP' can describe an object that has a spiral form and is three-dimensional.\n3. Notched or uneven, as if gnawed away - the word 'RAGGY' is valid and describes something that is notched or uneven.\n4. A drinker; a sedative - 'SLEEP' can refer to something that induces sedation or rest.\n5.
